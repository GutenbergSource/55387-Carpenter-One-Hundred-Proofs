      <dc:description>This curious pamphlet is a nice example of how people can reason towards a certain conclusion, and refuse to accept any piece of evidence or rational explanation that contradicts their position. Many of the ‘proofs’ given here are what some scientist would qualify as ‘not even wrong’. Identifying the logical fallacies commited is left as an exercise for the reader. Sadly, flat-earth societies exist to this day, mostly fueled by religious fundamentalism, just as anti-evolution and climate change deniers often are, although they will often try to hide that fact.</dc:description>
