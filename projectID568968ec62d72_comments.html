<HTML><BODY>In the ongoing effort of documenting human delusions, this curious pamphlet is a nice example of
how people can reason towards a certain conclusion, and basically refuse to accept any rational
explanation or evidence that contradict their conclusion. Some flat-earth societies exist to this
day, mostly fueled by religious fundamentalism, just as anti-evolution and climate change deniers
often are, although they will often try to hide that fact.

<p>This particular pamphlet was pretty rare, and hence the digitized version available was not
entirely intact. I believe every word can be restored, so am running it through PP.

<p>Have fun!
